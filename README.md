The best way to think about data within Scikit-Learn is in terms of tables of data. For example, consider the Iris dataset, famously analyzed by Ronald Fisher in 1936. # Supervised learning example: Iris classification. Our question. Given a model trained on a portion of the Iris data, how well can we predict the remaining labels?
